We accept a wide range of phone number formats and are equipped to extract locality information from the formats provided. However, for optimal compatibility and accuracy, we recommend submitting phone numbers in the [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164)
. This format includes:

*   A '+' sign followed by the country code.
*   The national phone number without any leading zeros or other formatting characters.

For example, a US phone number like (415) 123-4567 would be formatted as +14151234567 in E.164 format.

Using the E.164 format helps ensure that the numbers are recognized and processed correctly by our system, regardless of their origin. This standardization is particularly important in a global context, where phone number formats can vary significantly from one region to another.
