For effective link handling as a merge tag, it's important to format the link correctly. Include 'https://': Ensure your link begins with 'https://'. This is crucial for our system to recognize and process the link appropriately. For instance, use [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)
 instead of [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)
.

**Why It Matters:**

*   **Link Shortening:** Without 'https://', the link wonâ€™t be shortened, affecting its presentation in messages.
*   **Click Tracking:** Proper tracking of clicks, essential for engagement analytics, requires the full URL format.  
    Remember to check that all links in your messages start with 'https://' to ensure they are clickable and trackable.
