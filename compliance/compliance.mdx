description: "Subscribers must confirm opting in for automated messages"

At Postscript, we take compliance seriously (and think you should too!). What that means for our partners is that all subscribers added through our API are required to confirm they have opted in to receive recurring automated messages. If a subscriber does not confirm, then they are not added to a merchant's subscriber list.

The exact language of the confirmation message sent to subscribers is: `[Business name]: Reply Y to subscribe to recurring automated promotional msgs (e.g. cart reminders). Msg & data rates may apply.`

This message is currently not customizable.

Another thing to note about compliance is that wherever you are collecting a subscriber's phone number (e.g. a form) you should make sure to include TCPA-compliant language, for example:

`*By signing up, I agree to receive recurring automated marketing text messages (e.g. cart reminders) at the phone number provided. Consent is not a condition to purchase. Msg & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies. Reply HELP for help and STOP to cancel. View our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.`
