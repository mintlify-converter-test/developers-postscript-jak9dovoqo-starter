No, the process has been simplified in the V2 API. Unlike the V1 API, where you had to manually install triggers for each partner, the V2 API automates this process. Here's how it works:

*   **Automatic Registration:** When you send the first event payload for a new event type using the V2 API, the system automatically "installs" or "registers" this event. This means you don't have to go through a separate installation process for each event type as you did with the V1 API.
*   **Visibility in Flow Builder:** Once an event type is registered through its first payload, it becomes visible and usable within the Flow Builder. This allows for a more streamlined and efficient setup, as you can immediately start incorporating these events into your Flows.

This change represents a significant improvement in ease of integration and usability, making the process more straightforward and developer-friendly.
